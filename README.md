# Sentinel AI: Smart City Emergency Response System

## What is Sentinel AI?
Sentinel AI is a emergency response framework for Smart Cities which aims at adding comprehensive scalability and cross functionality.

## How is Sentinel AI different from existing solutions?
- Sentinel AI aims for modularity while maintaining a direct link between emergency response teams and the infrastructure
- Sentinel AI uses multimodal docker images deployed at edge nodes for accurately detecting and notifying the response teams
- Since notifications are sent straight to the response team, the middleman is cut out completely
- Incase of a false positive, the emergency dashboard can report so and it will be used for future training of the models for high accuracy
